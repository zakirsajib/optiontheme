-------
This is a basic options panel for a theme which could be used for a learning guide for any new developers.


<b>Instructions</b>

Add following line inside functions.php file.

$current_path= dirname(__FILE__);
require_once($current_path. '/theme-options.php'); // Theme options

All options code inside the 'templ' folder.

Still I need to show how the option values need to be used so please hang on.

Two more new options are added 

1. Login page
2. Dashboard area

These could be found inside login and dashboard folder. 

Still I need to show how they work.

Will come back tomorrow.
